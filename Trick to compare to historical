1.  Save the data to a local Sumo reference table periodically (ie: daily).. for example:

   | avg(blah) as avg_blah_ref, sum(blah) as sum_blah_ref, count(blah) as count_blah_ref by src_ip //, or whatever
   | "key12345" as key
   | save shared/blah/reference.csv
   
   that will save those value, keyed by "key12345" into a refence table
   
   
2.  To compare and lookup, you can do the following every hour or 10min:

   | avg(blah) as avg_blah, sum(blah) as sum_blah, count(blah) as count_blah by src_ip //, or whatever
   | "key12345" as key
   | lookup avg_blah_ref, sum_blah_ref from shared/blah/reference.csv on key=key
   // decsion points
   | where avg_blah > avg_blah_ref
