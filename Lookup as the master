Here is the logic.. Took me some time to think it through.  Thanks goes to Rishma for asking the tough question.

Save a one liner with a common key in the lookup table.  For example:

key           value
key123        a,b,c,d

When used as a lookup, you do something like this..

blah blah | extract xyz | count xyz | "key123" as blah_key | lookup value from shared/the_lookup on key=blah_key
| extract field=value "(?<v>[^,]+)" multi
| (xyz=v) ? "1" : "0" as matched
| sum(matched) by v | where _sum=0

So that means if v exists in xyz, then the _sum will be 1.  If v does not, then the _sumo will be 0.

Likewise, if you do a sum(matched) by xyz, that would means left join from xyz.

So, what happens if you need to validate say a master list of RPMs that you want to make sure are on all the hosts..
first, create you RPM lookup master LINE.. not a table, called it rpm.txt.
key      value
----    ------
key123   rpm-abc-1.0, rpm-xyz-2.0,blah1, blah2, blah3...

Then you extract the RPM and the hostname

blah blah | extract host, host_rpm | count host, host_rpm
| "key123" as blah_key
| lookup value from rpm.txt on key=blah_key
| extract field=value "(?<v>[^,]+)" multi
| (v=host_rpm) ? "1" : "0" as matched  // this line means the item in the master list showed up in query
| sum(matched) by host,v | where _sum=0

have fun,
