Here is the logic.. Took me some time to think it through.  Thanks goes to Rishma for asking the tough question.

Save a one liner with a common key in the lookup table.  For example:

key           value
key123        a,b,c,d

When used as a lookup, you do something like this..

blah blah | extract xyz | count xyz | "key123" as blah_key | lookup value from shared/the_lookup on key=blah_key
| extract field=value "(?<v>[^,]+)" multi
| (xyz=v) ? "1" : "0" as matched
| sum(matched) by v | where _sum=0

So that means if v exists in xyz, then the _sum will be 1.  If v does not, then the _sumo will be 0.

Likewise, if you do a sum(matched) by xyz, that would means left join from xyz.

have fun,
