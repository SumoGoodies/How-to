Configure OpenVPN-AS server sysloging.  Reference https://docs.openvpn.net/docs/access-server/openvpn-access-server-command-line-tools.html#log-database

0. Goto Sumo collectors page, create a syslog source listening to a port, ie: TCP/1514

1.  You need to be able to SSH into the OpenVPN server.  

2.  Add SYSLOG=true at the end of /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf

3.  Restart the OpenVPN AS service. 
    /etc/init.d/openvpnas restart
    
    After restart, you should be able to validate the openvpn is actually logging into /var/log/syslog

4. sudo vi /etc/rsyslog.d/99Sumo.conf and add one liner
*.* @@sumo_collector_ip:port

    You can validate the connectivity by doing a simple telnet to the collector:port testing (assuming TCP used).  You might need to open the firewall.

5. restart the rsyslog.d by running sudo service rsyslog restat

6.  Validate in Sumo that logs are flowing.
