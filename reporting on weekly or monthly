First, if you run a report against more than 30 days of data, make sure your data is in a view or a partition..


For monthly on the first of the month.. run this 

_index=sumologic_volume _sourceCategory="sourcehost_volume"
| formatDate(now(),"d") as curDay 
| where curDay="1"
| "do your thing" as here 


For up to date this month.. run this daily for the last 31 days, but only accumulate up to date.

_index=sumologic_volume  _sourceCategory="sourcehost_volume"
| parse regex "(?<sourcehost>\"[^\"]+\")\:\{\"sizeInBytes\"\:(?<bytes>\d+),\"count\"\:(?<count>\d+)\}" multi
| timeslice 1d
| formatDate(now(),"M") as curMonth 
| formatDate(fromMillis(_timeslice),"M") as MiY 
| where MiY=curMonth
| bytes/1024/1024/1024 as gbytes| sum(gbytes) as gbytes by _timeslice



For weekly
schedule this query to run daily at x:xx time against -7 days, but only really run it on Thursday

index=sumologic_volume sourceCategory="sourcehost_volume"
| formatDate(now(),"E") as curDay 
| where curDay="Thu"
| "do your thing" as here
