Credit goes to Rishma Gupta for coming up with the original query..

The idea here is first select the threee type of logs that you are interested (counting _raw is a story in its own, not to be shared here).

Join needs parts..

Part 1 is extract the username and session id
part 2 is actually a transaction function detecting start/end session time.


_sourceCategory=*vpn*  ((New session) OR (Session deleted) OR (Username)) | count _raw,session_id,_messagetime 
|join (parse "Username '*'" as username) as t2, (transaction  on session_id with "*New session*" as started , with "*Session deleted*"  as ended | where started>0 and ended=0 | (now()-_start_time)/60000 as duration_mins) as t1 on t2.session_id =t1.session_id | fields t1_session_id, t2_username, t1_duration_mins| sort by t1_duration_mins
