Because AWS SES does not log to CloudTrial, AWS recommended use SNS as a mean to get notifications on email services.

1.  In Sumo, create an HTTP source and copy that URL, choose treate each message as a whole message (one of the options near the bottom).
2.  In AWS-SNS, create a topic, call it SES_Notification (or whatever you want it to be called).
3.  In AWS-SNS, create a subscription, and enter the URL from Sumo.
4.  in AWS-SNS, click on the confirmation request.  This will fire an request message to Sumo.
5.  In Sumo, look for the request message and there is an embedded "confirmation" URL.  Copy that.
6.  In AWS-SNS, click on the confirmation button, and paste in the confirmation URL.  This will validate Sumo as a subscriber.

If you are just concerned about enabling SNS integration to Sumo, you are done.
7.  In SES, select a "verified" sender email and choose details.  
    You will have one or more.  So, if you want to enable for more than one, you will need to repeat the next step.
8.  Choose the "Notification" section, and enable those and notify the SNS subject created earlier.
