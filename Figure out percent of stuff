I've been asked this about once a month.. here is it.

Let's suppose I'm looking at a bunch webserver log of some kind.  In some messages, you'll have cookie fields, and sometimes cookies contains a specific HD_DC cookie.
Now, you want to know what percentage of the request contains the cookie field, and what percent of the cookies has HD_DC cookie.

Something like below would be helpful.

| cookie matches "*HD_DC*" ? "1" : "0" as hasDCcookie 
| cookie matches "*" ? "1" : "0" as hasCookie 
| sum(hascookie) as cookies, sum(hasDCcookie) as hasDC, count as total_lines
| cookies*100/total_lines as request_with_cookie_pct
| hasDC*100/cookies as pct_cookie_has_DC

and the result will be something like


#	cookies	hasdc	total_lines	request_with_cookie_pct	pct_cookie_has_dc
1	2,517,647	2,444,952	2,754,683	91.39516	97.11258


------
Some people would ask, what if I want to see either this or that as a percentage.. there is nothing to stop anyone doing (a or b).

for example:
| cookie matches "*HD_DC*" ? "1" : "0" as hasDCcookie 
| cookie matches "*MCC_THROTTLE*" ? "1": "0" as hasMCC
| (cookie matches "*HD_DC*" or cookie matches "*MCC_THROTTLE*") ? "1" : "0" as hasEither
| cookie matches "*" ? "1" : "0" as hasCookie 
| sum(hascookie) as cookies, sum(hasDCcookie) as hasDC, sum(hasMCC) as hasMCC, sum(hasEither) as hasEither, count as total_lines
| cookies*100/total_lines as request_with_cookie_pct
| hasDC*100/cookies as pct_cookie_has_DC
| hasMCC*100/cookies as pct_cookie_has_MCC
| hasEither*100/cookies as pct_cookie_hasEither
